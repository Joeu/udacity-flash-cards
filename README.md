# Flashcard application in React Native

### That's a fully functional flashcard application for Udacity's React nanodegree program, where the user is able to create Decks containing Cards with Q&A and answer them later.
### The Application has persistence and notification features.

### `Get the project up running`


In the project directory, you can one of the options below:

```
npm install 

yarn install
```

and then (also one of the following):

```
npm start

yarn start
```

Finally, open the Expo Client application in your Android smartphone which can be downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www). The Application will be built and then it will start.
